## Description

I am an iOS developer and currently learning Swift.

First,I learned basic grammar and practice with playground.

Then I will complete some mini projects,and summarize what I learned from the project.

## Summary

### Project1

* build UI with storyboard,perform segue to transfer parameter
* more familiar with swift basic grammar，such as  
  ```optional type``` ```if let...{}``` ```guard let...else{}``` 
    
* using ```UITableViewController```directly,less code to me
* learned the access level in swift,from high to low:  
  ```open```,```public```,```internal```,```fileprivate```,```private```  
  the default is ```internal```

### Project2

* using different kinds of UI controls
* learned ```enum Optional<Wrapped>```,Cooperate with ```switch```,like:
  
  ```
  switch someOptional {
  
  	case .some(let someOptional):
  	//do something
  	
  	case .none:
  	//do something
  }
  ```
* learned how to use ```extension``` flexibly
